description = "Hello Fort Worth!! Welcome to my first post on this **awesome** new decentralized website! You or your business may be wondering how can I get a domain name that can act as your digital identity, wallet, or your business name. You can buy a Fort Worth subdomain such as auto.fortworth.eth, lawyer.fortworth.eth, or 000.fortworth.eth. Your domain name can be just about anything you want as long as somebody else does not already own it. You can buy a subdomain that is attached to fortworth.eth by contacting me at nftsoke@gmail.com. Or if you want to learn more about ENS domain names you can go [here](https://ens.domains)."
